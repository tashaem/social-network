# CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript
### Project 4: Social Network
This twitter-like web app that allows users to post on their page, visit and follow other pages, and navigate through their general and "following" feeds.
In this project, I learned how to use Javascript to communicate with the back-end code, sending and processing information in JSON.
The views related to user authorization (login, register, logout) was provided by Harvard's CS50 staff in the project's distribution code.
